## Project Content 

## **What is this site's *purpose*?**

I'd like to build a site for professionals who work by appointment. For the first few users I will add personal friends in the beauty industry and post their weekly cancellations for them to save them from being a slave to instagram DMs.

## **Introduction**  

I'd like to use this for either a nicely written paragraph or just as a list of directives for users. I think this will start out as a list of people, then I would like to be able to sort them by location.

* Covid has increased last minute cancellations leaving stylists chairs empty. Here's you're chance to snap up an appointment that fits your schedule when you need it most.

* Keep up to date on your favorite service provider's last minute availablity.  

* Get in with a talented stylist who is usually booked weeks out in advance.

* Did you get a last minute event invite and now you *need* your hair or make up done? We're here for you.
  * Find a last minute opening for a great stylist in your area without calling all over town.

* Availability is subject to change.
