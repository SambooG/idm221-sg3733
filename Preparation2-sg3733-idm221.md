## Project Inspiration

## [Minale and Mann](https://minaleandmann.com/)

- I love the simplicity with the the text being a litle softer against the black background, making it a little more modern instead of like a terminal.
- The images, which are so clean and some even seem to draw me into the screen once I've clicked the cover image for the project.
- The logo is always on the screen, but it's unassuming, it looks like part of the design, not a pushy 'look at me' brand name.
- I like the that photos span the width of the screen and the text is dedication to each photo as I scroll the page instead of clicking through a bunch of photos with an arrow.

- The backgrounds that the video of models walk in front of are so fun.
- When you land on the page, you're seeing a recap of all of the cool stuff that went on.
- Any tab I would look for is sittin at the top minding it's business, and easy to find.
- Right below the cool into is a directory of designers that is searchable making it easy and availle for the user. Also with pictures, which I enjoy as it's more fun than text.

## [skims](www.skims.com)

- I know it's a Kardashian thing, I can't help it. They're good at what they do, and there is a screaming Kanye West influence. I love the photos, they give off a me and my friend at home taking photos together if we were millionaires vibe or something that would hang on a corkboard for idea development, but polished. Don't hate me, I'm already a little embarassed by how much i like it.
- The color story is so smooth to me. they items float in space as you scroll through, it's organized for the gawds. This coming from someone whose constitution even hates beige.
- I love that the page blurs behind the drop-down when you click on a section on the menu bar.
- They do a really good job of featuring the product and focusing on it even cutting off model's faces, which is normally a no-no for the emotional buy. It's just a beautiful underwear website. I like that they almost look 3-d.
